* customtkinter
* openai
* TTS
* sounddevice
* numpy
* threading
* torch
* speech_recognition
* json

**Installation:**

1. Clone the repository or download the code.
2. Install the required dependencies using `pip install -r requirements.txt`.
3. Create a file named `api_key.txt` and add your OpenAI API key to it.
4. Replace `"add api key"` in the code with the actual content of `api_key.txt`.

**Usage:**

1. Run the Python script.
2. The chatbot interface will appear.
3. Type your message in the input field or use the voice input button.
4. Select a voice and scenario for the chatbot's response.

**Customization:**
